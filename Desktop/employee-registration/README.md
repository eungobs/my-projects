# Employee Registration App

## Project Overview

The **Teekga ELECTRICAL Company Registration App** is designed to help manage employee records effectively. This application allows an admin to log in securely and perform essential tasks on employee data. Admins can create, read, update, and delete employee records to ensure that the information is always current. The app also helps you see the status of employees, including who is active, who has been deactivated, and who has transferred to other company branches.

### Key Features

1. **Admin Access Only**: Only the admin can log in to the app. To manage employee records, you will need to use the admin credentials:
   - **Username**: Elizabeth Ndzukule

2. **Employee Status**: You can view employees based on their status, such as active employees, deactivated employees, and those who have moved to other locations.

3. **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work well on both computers and mobile devices, providing a good experience no matter the device being used.

4. **Built-in Security**: The app is developed with a focus on security, helping to keep employee data safe and private.

## Technologies Used

The app is built using several technologies:
- **React.js**: A library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript**: Used to manage the application's core functions.
